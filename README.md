## 🎮 How to Play

1. When the game starts, you'll see a 3×3 board.
2. Players take turns typing the numbers corresponding to the cell where they want to place their mark (X or O).
3. The program checks after each turn for:
   - A win (three in a row, column, or diagonal),
   - Or a draw (board full with no winner).
4. If a player wins or the game ends in a draw, the game announces the result and exits.
5. Invalid moves (like choosing an already occupied cell or an out-of-range numbers) will prompt a retry.
