## 🎮 How to Play

1. When the game starts, you'll see a 3×3 board with numbered cells (1 to 9).
2. Players take turns typing the number corresponding to the cell where they want to place their mark (X or O).
3. The program checks after each turn for:
   - A win (three in a row, column, or diagonal),
   - Or a draw (board full with no winner).
4. If a player wins or the game ends in a draw, the game announces the result and exits.
5. Invalid moves (like choosing an already occupied cell or an out-of-range number) will prompt a retry.
